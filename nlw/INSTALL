INSTALL -- How to install Socialtext Open

@COPYRIGHT@

== Overview ==

Thanks for downloading Socialtext Open. 

Currently, you can install Socialtext Open on Ubuntu in under an hour, 
following the instructions in INSTALL.ubuntu.   

Socialtext Open has a huge number of capabilities. Installation on platforms 
other than Ubuntu are possible, but can be complicated and may take some time.  
We trust you'll find it worth the effort.

Here's a high-level overview to installing Socialtext Open, with
pointers to more detailed information.

* Install development tools

    Due to the number of dependencies, you will likely need to install
    the basic set of development tools and libraries appropriate for
    your version/flavor of Unix/Linux.  At a minimum, you will need
    make and a c compiler.

* Install apache-perl

    apache-perl is the name of the Debian package that contains
    Apache1 with mod_perl support.  We've kept that nomenclature.
    See docs/INSTALL.apache-perl for instructions on how to build
    your own from source if your distribution does not include such
    a package.

* Install Apache2; needed for the dual-Apache proxy setup.

    In Debian, the package to install is apache2-mpm-prefork.  Other
    distributions may have others.  It's important that it include
    the internal Apache proxy server modules built for it.

* Install the Freetype libraries, libfreetype6-dev

    Socialtext generates images on the fly for the Wikiwyg editor.  It
    uses some provided fonts and the Freetype system to do so.

* Install, configure and start PostgreSQL

    See docs/INSTALL.postgres for details

* Install the CPAN dependencies and optional programs

    See docs/INSTALL.dependencies for details, or you can let the
    configuration step do it for you.

* Configure, build and install Socialtext

    See "How to: Configure Socialtext" later in this document.

* Upgrade your Socialtext 1.x database to 2.x, if appropriate.

    See UPGRADE if necessary.

* Create your Socialtext users

    See "How to: Create your Socialtext users" later in this document

* Start Socialtext

    See "How to: Start Socialtext" later in this document

* Understand the support programs

    See "Support programs" later in this document


== How to: Configure Socialtext ==

Socialtext Open is a Perl web application that makes heavy use of mod_perl
and CPAN.  Some 150+ CPAN modules are required, some of which don't have
prebuilt packages for your OS (or the prebuilt packages are too old).

Installation starts with running a simple program, "configure":

    ./configure --socialtext-open=1

These configuration options tell the configuration script that you
are running an open source installation (which minimizes the rewrite
rules in your apache configuration file).

When you run it, you're presented with a list of settings that the files
are built with:

    $ ./configure --socialtext-open=1
    Configuration Settings:
             BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
           CACHEDIR = /var/cache/socialtext
            CONFDIR = /etc/socialtext
    etc...

You can modify these settings by using either environment variables or command
line switches to configure.  For example:

    $ ./configure --webroot=/var/www/myst
    or
    $ WEBROOT=/var/www/myst ./configure

Use ./configure --help for help or ./configure --varlist for a list
of variables you can set.  Please check the configuration variables
carefully.

Sometimes configure can't determine your fully-qualified hostname.
If your server is called myserver, and you're in the domain
mydomain.com, your HOSTNAME may just be HOSTNAME=myserver, which
may not resolve correctly for others outside of mydomain.com.  You'll
want to force the hostname to myserver.mydomain.com, like so:

    $ ./configure --hostname=myserver.mydomain.com

Once the Makefile has been created, you can then build, test and
install.  Run make to build the software:

    $ make
    ... # much building

Then you can optionally run make test to test the build.  You'll
need to have a special testing database set up for the tests to
work with.  See docs/INSTALL.postgres for details.

    $ make test
    ... # much testing

Finally, install Socialtext Open.

    $ sudo make install
    ... # much installing

You have now installed the software parts of Socialtext Open,
although it has not yet started at this point.


== How to: Create your Socialtext users ==

After you've installed Socialtext, you'll have to create at least
one user and one workspace.  From the command line, as the Apache
user, you use the st-admin command-line tool.

In these examples, we assume the environment variable APACHE_USER
has the name that Apache 1 will be running under, probably "www-data".
First, create a user for yourself:

    sudo -u $APACHE_USER \
        st-admin create-user \
        --email mymail@example.com \
        --password secretpublic \
        --first-name Pete \
        --last-name Shelley

Then add yourself to the help workspace as a workspace admin.  The
"help" workspace is the only one that exists at first.

    sudo -u $APACHE_USER \
        st-admin add-workspace-admin \
        --email mymail@example.com \
        --workspace help

== How to: Start Socialtext ==

Now you are ready to start Socialtext.  Make sure that you're not
running an instance of Apache already.  If you are, your Socialtext
instance of Apache will quietly fail.

Start the Socialtext Apache and the ceqlotron:

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/st-apache start
        # Starts Apache 1.3 + mod_perl using the Socialtext configuration.
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/ceqlotron start
        # Starts the Change Queue daemon, which processes wiki events.

At this point, you can point your browser to your domain:

    http://myserver.mydomain.com/

Log in with the user and password you set when you created your
Socialtext user.  You'll have full administrative privileges, and
can create workspaces at will under the "Settings" menu.

Most likely you will spend most of your time struggling to get Socialtext's
dependencies installed.  The dependencies come in two flavours: CPAN
dependencies and external system dependencies, which are both described below.


=== Support programs ===

Socialtext Open includes some utility programs for administering
your Socialtext installation, users and workspaces, as well as the
ceqlotron.  All Socialtext administration tools start with "st-",
and all ceqlotron-related tools start with "ceq-".

All programs support the --help command.  You can also say "man
programname" to get more information.

* st-admin -- The CLI interface to user and administration tasks.
This is what you can use to create and delete users, workspaces,
categories and so on.

* st-config -- Allows you to update configuration settings for
Socialtext without having to manually edit configuration files.

* ceq-stat -- Gives the status of the ceqlotron's queue.

* ceq-read -- Lists all the events in the ceqlotron's queue.

* ceq-rm -- Removes events from the ceqlotron's queue


Also included with the Socialtext Open distribution is the dev-bin/
directory, containing a number of utilities that we use at Socialtext,
but are not installed with "make install".  You probably won't use
them during your day-to-day administration of your installation,
but we thought they might be of interest to open source developers.
Be careful here, as some utilities may be dangerous to your data,
or may even be out of date.  They are meant only for developers,
and are not supported.
