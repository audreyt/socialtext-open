UPGRADE.1.x-to-2.0 -- How to upgrade Socialtext Open from 1.x to 2.0

@COPYRIGHT@

Upgrading your 1.x Socialtext Open to 2.0 is simple.  Database schema
changes are handled automatically as part of the installation process,
and the installation process has not changed.

The one thing you'll need to do is upgrade your workspace navigation
pages and homepages for all workspaces already installed.  We provide
programs to handle this for you.

== DETAILS ==

1.  Install Socialtext Open 2.0 as you did before, using the instructions
in INSTALL.  Don't start your Apache processes yet.

2.  Run the workspace rename program:

    $ sudo -u www-data dev-bin/migration/rename-workspace-navigation-to-announcements-and-links

    This script renames the "Workspace Navigation" page to
    "Announcements and Links", ensuring that it shows up on the
    Dashboard (a feature new to 2.0).

3.  Run the homepage/dashboard update program

    $ sudo -u www-data dev-bin/migration/update-homepage-is-dashboard

    This sets the "homepage_is_dashboard" configuration setting, based on
    whether or not the workspace is readable by guests.

4.  Start up Apache (and Apache2, if you're using the proxy).

5.  Check that everything works to your satisfaction.

6.  Delete the old workspace home pages

    $ sudo -u www-data dev-bin/migration/rename-workspace-navigation-to-announcements-and-links --delete

That's it.  Your Socialtext Open is ready to go.
