INSTALL.st-dev -- How to set up a Socialtext development environment

@COPYRIGHT@

# This document is an internal Socialtext document for describing how
# Socialtext developers can set up their own development environments,
# on a fresh Ubuntu install.  It's not intended for end users.
#
# But if you want to read it, go ahead.




# Install some basic packages.  The ones above the blank are required for
# Socialtext (or essential to admining of Socilatext), the ones below are just
# needed for a devbox:
sudo apt-get install \
    apache libapache-mod-perl libcpanplus-perl libfile-chdir-perl pmtools \
    libssl-dev libxml-sax-perl libxml2-dev ca-certificates exim4 \
    lsof ltrace mtools netcat nmap screen strace unzip wamerican-large \
    miscfiles wv bzip2 zip zsh \
    subversion apache-doc debhelper dh-make dpkg-dev \
    perltidy perl-doc dh-make-perl perl-debug \
    gcc gdb libc6-dev manpages-dev apache-dev postgresql linux-kernel-headers \
    links bc ccze dict \
    emacs21-nox apache2 apache2-mpm-prefork \
    libpng3 libpng3-dev libungif4-dev  libjpeg62-dev \

# You'll also need to install the libpq-dev package, which seems like it's
# currently named "postgresql-dev" on ubuntu.


# Johnt, can you re-set-up apt.socialtext.net to make this true again? {{{

# Add the socialtext apt repo to /etc/apt/sources.list:
#  deb http://apt.socialtext.net binary/

# TODO - Document the pinning stuff we finally figured out.

# Then slurp in all of our packages:
wget http://apt.socialtext.net/alldebs -q -O - | tee alldeb
sudo apt-get install `<alldeb`
# Note: Currently (Jul05), the packages that have been made just for
# socialtext don't have signatures, so you'll get a prompt.

# }}}


# Now for some apache pre-config:
# Make sure /etc/hosts has something like the following (so the server won't
# think its name was localhost.localhost):
# 65.87.18.219    dev-asp.socialtext.net
# ...and:
# Keep the default server from wasting our resources (note: when we switch to
# a DSO mod_perl, this apache will be the correct one, not apache_perl):
sudo /etc/init.d/apache stop
sudo update-rc.d -f apache remove
sudo update-rc.d apache stop 91 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 .

# For en_US.UTF-8
[ `locale -a | grep en_US.utf8` ] && sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

# workaround our "standardization on /usr/local/bin/perl":
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl

# Some Pre-prereqs (Note: As of Jun05, the package of
# libperl-module-build-perl (0.26) is not a high enough version for Socialtext
# (which wants 0.261))
# We also had to cpan install ExtUtils::CBuilder so that Module::Build would
# have C_support, which was needed for later deps
sudo cpanp -i Module::Build Kwiki Cache::FileCache # XXX need to be .debs

# Then, from your Socialtext checkout directory:
perl Build.PL # (ignore the dependency warnings)
sudo ./Build install_maintained_dependencies 

# You might run into some bumps along the way.  As of -r6269, there no
# ordering handled for modules/tarballs, so DBD-Pg attempts to install before
# DBI, which means it fails.  You'll need at least CPAN 0.55, or else
# Socialtext::Build::Deps complains about the inability to parse any module names.
./Build install_other_dependencies # TODO - convert this to a bunch of .deb's

# This hack is crazy, but was necessary (Jun05) to get rid of an error that
# said "Cannot load Apache/Request/Request.so", so I put I put
# /usr/lib/perl5/auto/libapreq/ into /etc/ld.so.conf, and ran:
sudo ldconfig
