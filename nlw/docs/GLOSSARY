== ceqlotron

The ceqlotron is the program that handles the event queue for
Socialtext.  For example, whenever a page is updated, an event is
put in the queue to reindex that page, leaving the web server to
carry on the task of delivering data.  The ceqlotron comes along
and does that indexing.


== NLW

Nice Little Wiki, an old name for the Socialtext software.


== OSR

Open Source Release.  Same as Socialtext Open.  This was the code
name for Socialtext Open when the project started.
