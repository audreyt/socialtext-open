UPGRADE.to-2.7 -- How to upgrade to Socialtext Open 2.7

@COPYRIGHT@

Socialtext Open 2.7 includes a new search engine, KinoSearch.  If you're
upgrading from an older version of Socialtext Open, you'll need to reindex
your workspaces.  Search will NOT return any search results until this
reindexing is done.

First, get a list of your workspaces:

    $ st-admin list-workspaces
    help
    sales           # or whatever
    development     # yours are

Then, for each of your workspaces, reindex them:

    $ st-admin index-workspace --workspace YOUR_WORKSPACE

This will submit a task to the ceqlotron for each page in the workspace.
You can keep track of progress with ceq-stat:

    $ s
    $ ceq-stat
    Changes in queue:
      Attachment      5
      Page           73
      Workspace       0

      TOTAL          78

If you want to make the reindexing happen all at once in a single
process, you can use the --sync option.

    $ st-admin index-workspace --workspace YOUR_WORKSPACE --sync

This provides an order of magnitude performance increase over generating
individual page events and feeding them to the ceqlotron (e.g. 16 minutes
instead of 4 hours for a very large Socialtext internal workspace).
However, it also means that no one can use that workspace during the
reindexing time, because the reindexing process has a lock on the entire
workspace.

Whichever path to reindexing you choose, you can now delete the index
files used by Plucene:

    $ rm -fr /var/www/socialtext/plugin/*/plucene

That's it.  Enjoy the new capabilities of KinoSearch!
