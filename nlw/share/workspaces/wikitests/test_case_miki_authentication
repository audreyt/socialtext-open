| *Comment* | Test Case: Miki Authentication |  |

If this test fails, and it fails in IE 6 because IE 6 caches Miki pages even when it should not,
it leaves the workspace in auth-to-edit mode because it does not run teardown and that breaks all tests
that follow it. So we do this test in a scratch workspace instead
